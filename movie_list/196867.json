Originally left by her parents as a baby with the promise that they'd be back for her someday, it's been a hard knock life ever since with her mean foster mom Miss Hannigan.

Stacks believes he's her guardian angel, but Annie's self-assured nature and bright, sun-will-come-out-tomorrow outlook on life just might mean it's the other way around.", u'release_date': u'2014-12-19', u'popularity': 4.382693, u'original_title': u'Annie', 'directors': [84932, 2888], u'backdrop_path': u'/hqNff5zochp9hzo299wC4Uoy8M9.jpg', 'producers': [82511], u'vote_count': 200, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 6.3, 'casting': [1055235, 134, 9827, 6941, 21127, 31164, 22821, 1357266, 1533987, 1028458, 1533988, 26718, 10580, 113373, 204651, 159828, 521, 1377052, 943751, 18973, 18976, 131519], u'genre_ids': [10402, 35, 18, 10751], 'similar': [254470, 194662, 334074, 812, 9325, 109445, 11238, 46195, 10020, 27576, 11224, 11970, 38757, 224141, 10674, 15789, 15969, 1725, 353311, 13700], u'id': 196867, u'original_language': u'en'}
