With two weeks to sew up the contract, Dan gets a surprise: a woman he married on a drunken impulse nearly nine years before (annulled the next day) shows up to tell him he's the father of her twins, now seven, and she'll be in jail for 14 days for a political protest. Dan volunteers to keep the tykes, although he's up tight and clueless. With Charlie's help is there any way they can be dad and uncle, meet the kids' expectations, and still land the account?", u'release_date': u'2009-11-24', u'popularity': 1.74963, u'original_title': u'Old Dogs', 'directors': [15306, 15307, 57822], u'backdrop_path': u'/umf3xzegzsqT9lXVdYKxG8OR1No.jpg', 'producers': [68573], u'vote_count': 87, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 5.2, 'casting': [2157, 8891, 13922, 15033, 2876, 11164, 1897, 51298, 12931, 79792, 11827, 92509, 13567, 12110, 85500, 40481], u'genre_ids': [35, 10751], 'similar': [], u'id': 22949, u'original_language': u'en'}
