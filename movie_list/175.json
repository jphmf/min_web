{u'poster_path': u'/w4TWqa7SiXP0Hm4rkRnCfXwIeRK.jpg', u'title': u'The Big Blue', u'overview': u'Two men answer the call of the ocean in this romantic fantasy-adventure.  Jacques (Jean-Marc Barr) and Enzo (Jean Reno) are a pair of friends who have been close since childhood, and who share a passion for the dangerous sport of free diving. Professional diver Jacques opted to follow in the footsteps of his father, who died at sea when Jacques was a boy; to the bewilderment of scientists, Jacques harbors a remarkable ability to adjust his heart rate and breathing pattern in the water, so that his vital signs more closely resemble that of dolphins than men (he even considers a school of dolphins as his extended family).  As Enzo persuades a reluctant Jacques to compete against him in a free diving contest -- determining who can dive deeper and longer without scuba gear -- Jacques meets Johana (Rosanna Arquette), a beautiful insurance investigator from America, and he finds that he must choose between his love for her and his love of the sea.', u'release_date': u'1988-05-11', u'popularity': 2.303199, u'original_title': u'Le Grand Bleu', 'directors': [60, 59], u'backdrop_path': u'/eSZUjmpNSnQZ2Wp1IRdlbUpSAuz.jpg', 'producers': [59], u'vote_count': 122, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 7.6, 'casting': [1642, 1003, 2165, 1165, 2166, 2168, 2170, 2171, 2172, 2173, 2174, 2175, 2180, 2181], u'genre_ids': [12, 18, 10749], 'similar': [674, 2253, 1124, 1374, 64, 637, 16, 609, 1375, 1213, 711, 173, 158, 2640, 337, 471, 309, 1993, 23128, 343], u'id': 175, u'original_language': u'fr'}
