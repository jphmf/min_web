Rescuing Tatia (Emmanuelle Chriqui), a young Georgian schoolteacher separated from her family during the attack, the two reporters agree to help reunite her with her family in exchange for serving as their interpreter. As the three attempt to escape to safety, they witness--and document--the devastation from the full-scale crossfire and cold-blooded murder of innocent civilians.', u'release_date': u'2011-08-18', u'popularity': 0.858532, u'original_title': u'5 Days of War', 'directors': [1327180, 1189759, 16938, 1189760], u'backdrop_path': u'/lf6fUY6ufTUp8738jRWCLJmqfLh.jpg', 'producers': [16938], u'vote_count': 25, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 6.2, 'casting': [36669, 5576, 1271, 21721, 59192, 69122, 125628, 52890, 43202, 1118, 151013, 51670, 221553], u'genre_ids': [18], 'similar': [43552, 41357, 70616, 70634, 298030, 70632, 63038, 70640, 136400, 49953, 62206, 6415, 65759, 52451, 366384, 34367, 326859, 82657, 24150, 27932], u'id': 50601, u'original_language': u'en'}
