She brought her camera with her. The film that resulted from this series of tense encounters is absolutely sui generis in the history of cinema:  a 100% real-life thriller unfolding minute by minute before our eyes. Poitras is a great and brave filmmaker, but she is also a masterful storyteller: she compresses the many days of questioning, waiting, confirming, watching the world\u2019s reaction and agonizing over the next move, into both a great character study of Snowden and a narrative that will leave you on the edge of your seat as it inexorably moves toward its conclusion.', u'release_date': u'2014-10-10', u'popularity': 2.91784, u'original_title': u'Citizenfour', 'directors': [1078, 1436487, 220691], u'backdrop_path': u'/fluGetObCo2FxoJ6KaUzMvtOxVc.jpg', 'producers': [220691], u'vote_count': 235, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 7.9, 'casting': [1386089, 150882, 1326448, 1417332, 1417333, 1417334, 1417336, 1417337, 220691, 529913, 102786], u'genre_ids': [99], 'similar': [201088, 326723, 362129, 261810, 27576, 8838, 17795, 14942], u'id': 293310, u'original_language': u'en'}
