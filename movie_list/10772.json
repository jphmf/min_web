{u'poster_path': u'/7YCMQ6ybiSv67EJJ1cb2Q1WKX4T.jpg', u'title': u'Django', u'overview': u'Django is a 1966 Italian spaghetti Western film directed by Sergio Corbucci and starring Franco Nero in the eponymous role. The film earned a reputation as being one of the most violent films ever made up to that point and was subsequently refused a certificate in Britain until 1993, when it was eventually issued an 18 certificate. Subsequent to this the film was downgraded to a 15 certificate in 2004. Although the name is referenced in over thirty "sequels" from the time of the film\'s release until the mid 1980s in an effort to capitalize on the success of the original, none of these films were official, featuring neither Corbucci nor Nero. Nero did reprise his role as Django in 1987\'s Django 2: Il Grande Ritorno (Django Strikes Again), in the only official sequel to be written by Corbucci.', u'release_date': u'1966-04-05', u'popularity': 2.321075, u'original_title': u'Django', 'directors': [], u'backdrop_path': u'/mIgmo89c4gBc2KEpoTyimSywuM0.jpg', 'producers': [49450], u'vote_count': 38, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 7.0, 'casting': [22383, 66676, 66677, 37586, 100409], u'genre_ids': [28, 37], 'similar': [249070, 27576, 1620, 429, 682, 787, 266396, 1948, 27582, 51608, 4816, 9691, 11702, 1441, 9401, 4836, 4909, 5889, 20187, 61943], u'id': 10772, u'original_language': u'it'}
