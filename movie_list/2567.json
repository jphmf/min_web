After a scene from 1914, which may explain his later fear of dirt and disease, the film starts in 1927 during Hughes\' filming of the World War I aviation film "Hell\'s Angels". He\'s 22 years old, has inherited the family\'s fortune and tool company, but wants to spend his time making film instead. However, he soon finds himself just as involved in the aviation industry, buying an airline and developing new planes.', u'release_date': u'2004-12-25', u'popularity': 1.493987, u'original_title': u'The Aviator', 'directors': [27218, 27219, 16729, 638, 66185], u'backdrop_path': u'/lPkhOgbkrbPijXWtRoWyUCBIcY4.jpg', 'producers': [1032], u'vote_count': 488, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 6.6, 'casting': [6193, 112, 3967, 4764, 7447, 21278, 65, 9642, 17442, 6413, 1213786, 5293, 77070, 36801, 11154, 4432, 4171, 15318, 99185, 1218282], u'genre_ids': [18], 'similar': [157336, 602, 296098, 813, 11352, 709, 658, 11856, 27576, 857, 708, 744, 863, 141, 149870, 5559, 74, 1597, 55721, 225574], u'id': 2567, u'original_language': u'en'}
