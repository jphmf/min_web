The Airbus, bound for Paris, has 227 passengers on board. No one knows exactly what the terrorists\u2019 intentions are, just that they are armed and extremely determined.

There are three main characters at the heart of the action: a member of the GIGN, Carole Jeanton, an ambitious technocrat willing to do anything it takes to achieve personal gain from the events, and Yahia Abdallah, a determined jihadist who grew up in the slums of Algiers and was being manipulated by an obscure GIA envoy, Ali Touchent.', u'release_date': u'2010-11-12', u'popularity': 1.761401, u'original_title': u"L'assaut", 'directors': [], u'backdrop_path': u'/HXp4vg2V3N1xIJZWc8nW7AbezJ.jpg', 'producers': [84439], u'vote_count': 28, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 6.4, 'casting': [54918, 132431, 41881, 32707, 35965, 130558, 84440, 82318, 20086, 23670], u'genre_ids': [28, 53], 'similar': [86254, 109424, 225574, 127846, 41608, 58976, 92310, 230236, 281249, 54860, 158557, 868, 92798, 87367, 113167], u'id': 59145, u'original_language': u'fr'}
