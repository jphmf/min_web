With no adult survivors, they create their own "micro-society". Ralph is elected "chief", and he organises shelter and fire. Jack, the head of the choir takes his boys hunting for food (wild pigs). A bitter rivalry develops between Jack and Ralph as both want to be in charge. The "hunters" become savage and primal, under Jack\'s rule, while Ralph tries to keep his group civilised. The growing hostility between them leads to a bloody and frightening climax.', u'release_date': u'1963-08-13', u'popularity': 1.863954, u'original_title': u'Lord of the Flies', 'directors': [58812, 18754], u'backdrop_path': u'/uP1I6SCQwA3iv0mPfksVVXQhH6a.jpg', 'producers': [60981], u'vote_count': 20, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 5.8, 'casting': [60990, 584137, 584138, 584139, 584140], u'genre_ids': [12, 18, 10769, 53], 'similar': [8358, 5689, 41953, 13888, 115290, 11210, 54979, 313066], u'id': 9960, u'original_language': u'en'}
