The unicorn sets out to discover the truth behind the butterfly's words. She is eventually joined on her quest by Schmendrick, a second-rate magician, and Molly Grue, a now middle-aged woman who dreamed all her life of seeing a unicorn. Their journey leads them far from home, all the way to the castle of King Haggard.", u'release_date': u'1982-11-19', u'popularity': 1.897254, u'original_title': u'The Last Unicorn', 'directors': [16411, 16410], u'backdrop_path': u'/vvM6rA4Be344964qmyX45DI1Dck.jpg', 'producers': [16410, 16411], u'vote_count': 43, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 6.9, 'casting': [1903, 1229, 12021, 63998, 14730, 113, 12998, 16422, 4966, 26715, 16417, 9807, 16413, 103813, 84325, 1077310, 1077311], u'genre_ids': [14, 16, 10751], 'similar': [672, 674, 675, 673, 671, 10340, 767, 810, 2312, 10882, 2313, 756, 10804, 8390, 8874, 858, 10472, 844, 10641, 11232], u'id': 10150, u'original_language': u'en'}
