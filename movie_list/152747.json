{u'poster_path': u'/9hdfc5MA50LUBwGXwHyO4BoFi57.jpg', u'title': u'All Is Lost', u'overview': u"Deep into a solo voyage in the Indian Ocean, an unnamed man (Redford) wakes to find his 39-foot yacht taking on water after a collision with a shipping container left floating on the high seas. With his navigation equipment and radio disabled, the man sails unknowingly into the path of a violent storm. Despite his success in patching the breached hull, his mariner's intuition and a strength that belies his age, the man barely survives the tempest. Using only a sextant and nautical maps to chart his progress, he is forced to rely on ocean currents to carry him into a shipping lane in hopes of hailing a passing vessel. But with the sun unrelenting, sharks circling and his meager supplies dwindling, the ever-resourceful sailor soon finds himself staring his mortality in the face.", u'release_date': u'2013-10-18', u'popularity': 0.904962, u'original_title': u'All Is Lost', 'directors': [213863, 131609, 1062336, 1080589], u'backdrop_path': u'/ygQQHmscHQWmJ2uQzXdxLE9Yszz.jpg', 'producers': [556172], u'vote_count': 315, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 6.3, 'casting': [4135], u'genre_ids': [28, 12, 18], 'similar': [], u'id': 152747, u'original_language': u'en'}
