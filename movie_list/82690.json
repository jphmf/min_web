Wanting to prove he can be a good guy and not just a villain, Ralph escapes his game and lands in Hero's Duty, a first-person shooter where he helps the game's hero battle against alien invaders. He later enters Sugar Rush, a kart racing game set on tracks made of candies, cookies and other sweets. There, Ralph meets Vanellope von Schweetz who has learned that her game is faced with a dire threat that could affect the entire arcade, and one that Ralph may have inadvertently started.", u'release_date': u'2012-11-01', u'popularity': 3.869844, u'original_title': u'Wreck-It Ralph', 'directors': [928605, 69798], u'backdrop_path': u'/1HjKgkIdR2qw8ihM6MTxgdST2kM.jpg', 'producers': [165787], u'vote_count': 2972, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 6.9, 'casting': [4764, 7404, 43775, 58737, 95002, 76245, 21088, 125167, 21131, 18977, 352, 3202, 84495, 46074, 73128, 75038, 571225, 237163, 1173048, 34521, 294916, 165787], u'genre_ids': [10751, 16, 35, 12], 'similar': [602, 27576, 9975, 4723, 112058], u'id': 82690, u'original_language': u'en'}
