Despite this and other differences, including that she's rich, he's poor, and she's a city girl, he's a country boy, the two become fast friends. Together, they create Terabithia, a land of monsters, trolls, ogres, and giants and rule as king and queen. This friendship helps Jess cope with the tragedy that makes him realize what Leslie taught him.", u'release_date': u'2007-02-16', u'popularity': 2.235044, u'original_title': u'Bridge to Terabithia', 'directors': [54487, 7227, 54488], u'backdrop_path': u'/t45osFg8w2Kh7BzgYl1iYgi8IxF.jpg', 'producers': [36697], u'vote_count': 326, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 6.6, 'casting': [27972, 1285, 11664, 54478, 54479, 418, 54480, 54481, 54482, 54483, 54484, 5532, 54485, 54486, 54492, 54493, 54494], u'genre_ids': [12, 18, 10751], 'similar': [11236, 19101, 91951], u'id': 1265, u'original_language': u'en'}
