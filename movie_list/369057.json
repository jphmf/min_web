{u'poster_path': None, u'title': u'A Prince for Christmas', u'overview': u"When Jules Daly's sister and brother-in-law are tragically killed in an accident, Jules Daly (Katie McGrath) becomes guardian to her young niece Maddie and nephew Milo. On top of balancing the daily hysteria of becoming an overnight parent, Jules was recently laid off at work, her car is on the fritz, and the kids\u2019 shenanigans have caused a dozen nannies to flee.  When an ominous knock on the door comes late one evening, Jules wonders, what now? At the door is Paisley Winterbottom (Miles Richardson), a proper English butler, with a curious invitation: a Christmas holiday with grandfather, Edward (Roger Moore), the Duke of Castlebury Hall, who was absent from the kids\u2019 lives, but wants to reconnect out of love for his late son. Jules initially wants to decline the trip, but her eventual acceptance makes for a magical Christmas season for everyone.", u'release_date': u'2015-11-29', u'popularity': 2.690108, u'original_title': u'A Prince for Christmas', 'directors': [], u'backdrop_path': None, 'producers': [31155], u'vote_count': 0, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 0.0, 'casting': [224180, 1455179], u'genre_ids': [], 'similar': [], u'id': 369057, u'original_language': u'en'}
