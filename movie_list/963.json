That's for Sam Spade and Miles Archer. The two men are partners, but Sam doesn't like Miles much. A knockout, who goes by the name of Miss Wanderly, walks into their office; and by that night everything's changed. Miles is dead. And so is a man named Floyd Thursby. It seems Miss Wanderly is surrounded by dangerous men. There's Joel Cairo, who uses gardenia-scented calling cards. There's Kasper Gutman, with his enormous girth and feigned civility. Her only hope of protection comes from Sam, who is suspected by the police of one or the other murder. More murders are yet to come.", u'release_date': u'1941-11-18', u'popularity': 0.825954, u'original_title': u'The Maltese Falcon', 'directors': [14446], u'backdrop_path': u'/hQGUl6rlAfUFifCLb9bukpJH42P.jpg', 'producers': [6593], u'vote_count': 126, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 7.7, 'casting': [4110, 13992, 14450, 2094, 14451, 5740, 4114, 4303, 14452, 3339, 14453, 14454, 14455, 2776, 19020, 124875, 15978, 97981, 95311, 13856, 980330], u'genre_ids': [80, 18, 53], 'similar': [357096, 39918, 26390, 27576, 15069, 59967, 16825, 101299, 136597, 979, 260346, 245891, 402, 948, 10651, 10029, 10575, 238636, 4771, 956], u'id': 963, u'original_language': u'en'}
