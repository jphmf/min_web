{u'poster_path': u'/k0lQISUC4NuvKYasJn59JHc2rla.jpg', u'title': u'Mary and Max', u'overview': u"A tale of friendship between two unlikely pen pals: Mary, a lonely, eight-year-old girl living in the suburbs of Melbourne, and Max, a forty-four-year old, severely obese man living in New York. In the mid-1970's, a homely, friendless Australian girl of 8 picks a name out of a Manhattan phone book and writes to him; she includes a chocolate bar. She's Mary Dinkle, the only child of an alcoholic mother and a distracted father. He's Max Horowitz, living alone in New York, overweight, subject to anxiety attacks. He writes back, with chocolate. Thus begins a 20-year correspondence, interrupted by a stay in an asylum and a few misunderstandings. Mary falls in love with a neighbor, saves money to have a birthmark removed and deals with loss. Max has a friendship with a neighbor, tries to control his weight, and finally gets the dream job. Will the two ever meet face to face?", u'release_date': u'2009-04-09', u'popularity': 1.278508, u'original_title': u'Mary and Max', 'directors': [92735], u'backdrop_path': u'/akUyYgdcY3Q4WfbWLDB9Ur8ttFG.jpg', 'producers': [92733], u'vote_count': 270, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 7.5, 'casting': [3051, 1233, 8783, 22, 92731, 92732], u'genre_ids': [16, 35, 18], 'similar': [9989, 10180, 11854, 7350, 14247, 77338, 8736, 11122, 6477, 10158, 9317, 1429, 11455, 22597, 10102, 12622, 10278, 10770, 11908, 8052], u'id': 24238, u'original_language': u'en'}
