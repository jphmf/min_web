Highsmith (Jackson) are the baddest and most beloved cops in New York City. They don\'t get tattoos, other men get tattoos of them.

They\'re not heroes, they\'re "the other guys." But every cop has his or her day and soon Gamble and Hoitz stumble into a seemingly innocuous case no other detective wants to touch that could turn into NYC\'s biggest crime. It\'s the opportunity of their lives, but do these guys have the right stuff?', u'release_date': u'2010-08-06', u'popularity': 1.140224, u'original_title': u'The Other Guys', 'directors': [], u'backdrop_path': u'/awMESdeGymmNYTMhWvjJE5AP61a.jpg', 'producers': [55710], u'vote_count': 613, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 6.0, 'casting': [23659, 13240, 8170, 2231, 18918, 2232, 224197, 56614, 932748, 84459, 4581, 71403, 87822, 21127, 15110, 8256], u'genre_ids': [28, 35, 80], 'similar': [], u'id': 27581, u'original_language': u'en'}
