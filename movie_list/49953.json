{u'poster_path': u'/yywGlSbbcw1WeikWqVY2yxiMsTL.jpg', u'title': u"A Turtle's Tale: Sammy's Adventures", u'overview': u"A sea turtle who was hatched in 1959 spends the next 50 years traveling the world while it is being changed by global warming. Born on a Baja, California beach in 1959, new hatchling Sammy must do what his fellow newborn sea turtles are doing: race across the beach to the ocean before they are captured by a seagull or crab. Thus begins Sammy's incredible fifty-year ocean journey. Along the way he meets his best friend, a fellow turtle named Ray, and overcomes obstacles both natural and man-made while trying to fulfill his dream of travelling around the world. Throughout his voyage, Sammy never forgets about Shelly - the turtle he saved on his first day and loves passionately from afar. Based on the actual trajectory of a sea turtle's life, the film illustrates the dangers humans pose to the species' survival. The film combines entertainment with an important environmental message.", u'release_date': u'2011-03-25', u'popularity': 0.880759, u'original_title': u"Sammy's avonturen: De geheime doorgang", 'directors': [1008408, 161444, 104614, 76100, 1008412], u'backdrop_path': u'/idEOJz8WCuRpxNunYjjvCP8FI2y.jpg', 'producers': [76100], u'vote_count': 50, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 6.3, 'casting': [29369, 127387, 77517, 13472, 59620, 5049, 118616], u'genre_ids': [16, 10751], 'similar': [136400, 50601, 65759, 62206, 366384, 6415, 52451, 43552, 41357, 70616, 82657, 70634, 24150, 17700, 298030, 70632, 63038, 34367, 326859, 70640], u'id': 49953, u'original_language': u'en'}
