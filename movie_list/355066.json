As animals inhabiting streets Shero and his friends are after what anyone else in their notoriously sleazy Istanbul neighborhood wants: debauchery with girls, food and the occasional drinking binge. This ordinary looking day will prove otherwise as their paths cross with humans, things get a little out of hand in hilarious, harsh and unexpected ways.  The Bad Cat is an animated 3D feature film that strikes into our heads the epitome of what a bad cat who's deprived of love and barbeque is capable of. The story involves a sleazy, sexed up cat Shero, discovers he is the father of a bastard son.", u'release_date': u'2015-11-27', u'popularity': 1.790745, u'original_title': u'K\xf6t\xfc Kedi \u015eerafettin', 'directors': [], u'backdrop_path': None, 'producers': [], u'vote_count': 0, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 0.0, 'casting': [147775, 106785, 5120, 121426, 1254174, 121423, 145331, 1137204, 230759], u'genre_ids': [16], 'similar': [], u'id': 355066, u'original_language': u'tr'}
