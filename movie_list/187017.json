But when Jenko meets a kindred spirit on the football team, and Schmidt infiltrates the bohemian art major scene, they begin to question their partnership. Now they don't have to just crack the case - they have to figure out if they can have a mature relationship. If these two overgrown adolescents can grow from freshmen into real men, college might be the best thing that ever happened to them.", u'release_date': u'2014-06-13', u'popularity': 1.984608, u'original_title': u'22 Jump Street', 'directors': [21007, 38673, 11874], u'backdrop_path': u'/9NmTVqQ9f2ltecPZgXIj4Bk2c6s.jpg', 'producers': [107446, 155267], u'vote_count': 1570, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 7.1, 'casting': [21007, 38673, 54697, 9778, 17039, 53, 71403, 986808, 87295, 1187106, 1226302, 1304335, 1910, 141762, 141956, 18300, 996700, 1060081, 1772, 19278, 10872, 19274, 15758, 61632], u'genre_ids': [28, 35, 80], 'similar': [], u'id': 187017, u'original_language': u'en'}
