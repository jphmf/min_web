{u'poster_path': u'/kZ7BE0Ob664ZFuFrWNTm9eu62qW.jpg', u'title': u'Trespass', u'overview': u"Kyle (Nicholas Cage) and Sarah Miller (Nicole Kidman) have it all: a huge gated house on the water, fancy cars, and the potential for romance in their relationship. He's just back from a business trip (he brokers diamonds) and their teen daughter Avery (Liana Liberato) is sneaking out to a party, when four thugs in security uniforms and ski masks stage a home invasion. They want what's in the safe: cash and diamonds. As Kyle stalls them, trying to negotiate for Sarah's freedom, the fault lines in Kyle and Sarah's marriage and the pasts of the four robbers come into play. Is there room here for heroism?", u'release_date': u'2011-10-14', u'popularity': 2.413998, u'original_title': u'Trespass', 'directors': [550112, 207419, 11472], u'backdrop_path': u'/Rr5uWWzovjB3zACUHcMJqzFuE3.jpg', 'producers': [5572], u'vote_count': 121, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 5.4, 'casting': [2963, 55086, 2227, 60458, 127128, 39481, 6066, 77335, 147085, 558902, 558903, 558904, 71815], u'genre_ids': [80, 18, 53], 'similar': [11958, 27576, 238636, 59967, 769, 507, 2017, 193893, 21407, 10029, 26390, 867, 4771, 294652, 406, 133805, 73861, 36349, 9282, 291356], u'id': 70578, u'original_language': u'en'}
