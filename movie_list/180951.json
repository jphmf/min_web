The incendiary anti-Modernist Munnings, now regarded as one of Britain's most sought-after artists, is at the centre of the complex love triangle, involving aspiring artist Florence Carter-Wood and Gilbert Evans, the land agent in charge of the Lamorna Valley estate. True - and deeply moving - the story is played out against the timeless beauty of the Cornish coast, in the approaching shadow of The Great War.", u'release_date': u'2013-06-13', u'popularity': 0.801614, u'original_title': u'Summer in February', 'directors': [], u'backdrop_path': u'/ghvHtGUBH7FKx3Ll5qZno2cJuoC.jpg', 'producers': [68774], u'vote_count': 12, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 6.6, 'casting': [55470, 70456, 221018, 56103, 1262971, 86479, 75566, 17483, 32357], u'genre_ids': [18, 10749], 'similar': [152532, 769, 106646, 293646, 1955, 109264, 87492, 277216, 266856, 261023, 227306, 331781, 321697, 115782, 197, 600, 423, 228970, 140823, 272878], u'id': 180951, u'original_language': u'en'}
