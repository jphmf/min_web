In a dystopian 2021, Johnny (Keanu Reeves) is a data trafficker who has an implant that allows him to securely store data too sensitive for regular computer networks. On one delivery run, he accepts a package that not only exceeds the implant's safety limits - and will kill him if the data is not removed in time - but also contains information far more important and valuable than he had ever imagined. On a race against time, he must avoid the assassins sent to kill him and remove the data before it, too, ends his life.", u'release_date': u'1995-05-26', u'popularity': 1.998602, u'original_title': u'Johnny Mnemonic', 'directors': [8303], u'backdrop_path': u'/vNsGZPwf45rA3BrXEu8TVRwSqKF.jpg', 'producers': [59997], u'vote_count': 113, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 5.3, 'casting': [6384, 2133, 3317, 21411, 16644, 9290, 23378, 1646, 122159, 180682, 87461, 168614, 43301, 176006, 64888, 552452, 185133, 552453, 174954, 95002, 185092, 552454, 552455, 182946, 185109, 552456, 27560, 185125, 180917, 552457, 197795, 552458, 552459, 552460, 552461, 181020, 552462, 538687], u'genre_ids': [28, 12, 18, 878, 53], 'similar': [18839, 23535, 61954, 17189], u'id': 9886, u'original_language': u'en'}
