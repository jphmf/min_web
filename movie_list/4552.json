{u'poster_path': u'/8fmnXoIw3e3J7YSr8bzcPica4Dk.jpg', u'title': u'A Tale of Two Sisters', u'overview': u'Two young sisters recovering from an unnamed trauma must face a mysterious past in this excellent South Korean shocker. A worldwide hit upon its release and based on an old Korean fairy tale; two sisters come to live with their cold and distant father and turn-on-a-dime stepmother in a house where nothing is as it seems. A wonderfully haunting score, starkly beautiful imagery, and a labyrinthine plot that twists and turns at every dark corner all set the stage for a riveting and often terrifying guessing game of a movie. Equal parts drama, mystery, and ghost story, A Tale of Two Sisters is a richly complex and challenging cinematic treat that may very well demand repeat viewings.', u'release_date': u'2003-06-13', u'popularity': 2.284959, u'original_title': u'\uc7a5\ud654, \ud64d\ub828', 'directors': [69084, 120899], u'backdrop_path': u'/dHeWtDSsPOvj01rhKjmSNBJpYFq.jpg', 'producers': [543568], u'vote_count': 57, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 6.3, 'casting': [37940, 37939, 37941, 564846, 554560, 1173191, 1222431], u'genre_ids': [18, 27, 9648], 'similar': [44203, 26693, 158354, 199774, 9666, 11076, 24417, 5520, 303698, 301908, 199766, 90988], u'id': 4552, u'original_language': u'en'}
