{u'poster_path': u'/4WdJmlY03tktC7B6UM8sHxPfPcw.jpg', u'title': u'Page Eight', u'overview': u'Page Eight is lovingly turned, with elegant writing, a flawless cast and a heartfelt message from writer/director David Hare about the danger zone where spies and politicians meet.  The tension builds gently as we follow the fortunes of Johnny Worricker, a jazz-loving charmer who works high up at MI5 as an intelligence analyst. It\u2019s a part made for Bill Nighy and he purrs out bon mots with a weary panache that women 20 years younger find irresistible. One such is his neighbour, Nancy Pierpan (Rachel Weisz), in a Battersea mansion block. The question for Johnny is whether her interest in him is genuine or hides something darker.  As his boss (Michael Gambon) puts it: \u201cDistrust is a terrible habit.\u201d Questions of trust, honour and friendship rumble through the play. The characters exchange oblique repartee as a plot about a damning dossier unwinds. It\u2019s not to be missed.', u'release_date': u'2011-08-28', u'popularity': 0.835399, u'original_title': u'Page Eight', 'directors': [65614, 10968], u'backdrop_path': u'/A3lnBkzYcCgSRGVcuj7KbliLEHc.jpg', 'producers': [8403], u'vote_count': 24, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 6.4, 'casting': [5469, 3293, 2440, 5658, 72855, 116264, 351, 1147671, 13363, 1125, 25282, 2968, 47590, 2506, 1052165, 112824], u'genre_ids': [18, 9648, 53], 'similar': [260202, 260339, 1724, 26883, 36573, 19593, 1927, 205321, 30675, 79989, 230896, 36571, 248504, 15257, 36572, 65294, 331446, 41263, 32643, 369533], u'id': 73358, u'original_language': u'en'}
