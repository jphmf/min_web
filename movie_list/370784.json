{u'poster_path': None, u'title': u'When AIDS Was Funny', u'overview': u'Shows how the Reagan administration reacted to the mounting problem in chilling fashion. Not even Reagan\u2019s appointed mouthpiece, notorious press secretary Larry Speakes, had much to say about the crisis beyond derisive laughter.  Using never-before-heard audio tapes from three separate press conferences, in 1982, 1983, and 1984, When AIDS Was Funny illustrates how the reporter Lester Kinsolving, a conservative (and not at all gay-friendly) fixture in the White House press corps, was consistently scoffed at when he posed urgent questions about the AIDS epidemic. With snickering, homophobic jokes and a disturbing air of uninterest, Speakes dismisses Kinsolving\u2019s concerns about the escalating problem.', u'release_date': u'2015-12-01', u'popularity': 2.06164, u'original_title': u'When AIDS Was Funny', 'directors': [], u'backdrop_path': None, 'producers': [], u'vote_count': 0, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 0.0, 'casting': [], u'genre_ids': [], 'similar': [], u'id': 370784, u'original_language': u'en'}
