{u'poster_path': u'/cSkPYnVsD7MRNXPhkhBv3Mcxx39.jpg', u'title': u'Cop Out', u'overview': u'Officers Jimmy Monroe and Paul Hodges have their weapons drawn on a gun-wielding killer. They agree to shoot on three. But, wait, does that mean 1\u20262\u2026 shoot or 1\u20262\u20263\u2026 then shoot? Punches hit hard and laughs hit harder (or is it the other way \u2019round?) when action star Bruce Willis and ace comic Tracy Morgan pair as bickering-but-got-your-back Brooklyn buddy cops. Kevin Smith (Clerks, Chasing Amy) directs the gritty, goofball goings-on as the guys hunt for a stolen 1952 mint condition baseball card (Jimmy needs it to fund his daughter\u2019s wedding), a hunt plunging them into a gunslinging war with a deadly drug ring. Batter up, fans.
