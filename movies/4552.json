{u'poster_path': u'/7cRrMeFaJu4sQvd8lp0uTPte3Wh.jpg', u'title': u'A Tale of Two Sisters', u'overview': u'Two young sisters recovering from an unnamed trauma must face a mysterious past in this excellent South Korean shocker. A worldwide hit upon its release and based on an old Korean fairy tale; two sisters come to live with their cold and distant father and turn-on-a-dime stepmother in a house where nothing is as it seems. A wonderfully haunting score, starkly beautiful imagery, and a labyrinthine plot that twists and turns at every dark corner all set the stage for a riveting and often terrifying guessing game of a movie. Equal parts drama, mystery, and ghost story, A Tale of Two Sisters is a richly complex and challenging cinematic treat that may very well demand repeat viewings.', u'release_date': u'2003-06-13', u'popularity': 0.335345, u'original_title': u'\uc7a5\ud654, \ud64d\ub828', u'backdrop_path': u'/dHeWtDSsPOvj01rhKjmSNBJpYFq.jpg', u'vote_count': 57, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 6.3, u'genre_ids': [18, 27, 9648], u'id': 4552, u'original_language': u'en'}
